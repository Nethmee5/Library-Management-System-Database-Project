The project “Library Service Management System” is based on the database which we are creating Microsoft SQL server with showing relationships using primary keys and foreign keys in SQL language. The purpose of the project is to automate the existing system into e-management system with providing user friendly environment to maintain the details.
Library service management system project covers all the required modules as administrative module which is used to maintain the details of users of the system. Book issue and return module maintains all the details of issuing books and returning books of viewing status of any libraries. Member module contains all the details of members who are using Library Management System.
